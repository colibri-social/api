Keeps read state in step across a user's sessions. The new `sync.defs#readCursorEvent` carries a community and the read cursors that moved, and `channel.putReadCursors` sends it to every session of the caller. A read record that arrives through sync sends it too. `putReadCursors` and the read record projection keep the newer cursor per channel or thread, and leave channels the write omits untouched, so a cursor from a stale device never moves read state backwards. The `@colibri-social/projections` package exports the merge as `mergeReadCursors`. Following or unfollowing a thread sends the follower's sessions a `threadEvent` update with their new viewer state. A `seenEvent` sent for `notification.updateSeenForMessage` names the message in a new optional `message` field, so other sessions can clear that notification.
