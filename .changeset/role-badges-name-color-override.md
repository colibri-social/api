Adds role badges and a Space-wide name colour override. A role carries an optional `badge`, either an icon from the client's curated set with an optional colour or an uploaded image of up to 256 KB. `role.create` and `role.update` take an icon badge, `role.update` clears one with `removeBadge`, and the new `role.putBadgeImage` uploads an image badge as the community. Role views return the badge with image badges served through a signed members-space link. The community settings record, `community.create`, `community.update` and the community view gain `overrideUserNameColors`, which hides members' own name colours in chat so only role colours show, and a member without a coloured role gets the default name colour.
