# @colibri-social/emoji

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d2236e7: Users can follow a custom emoji pack or a single custom emoji. A follow is a private `social.colibri.beta.emoji.follow` record in the user's preferences space that points at the owner's pack or emoji, so renames, new images and pack membership changes reach followers.
  
  - `emoji.putFollow` pushes a follow record to the AppView, and a call without `subject` removes it.
  - `emoji.getLibrary` returns the user's own emoji plus everything they follow, each with an `available`, `missing` or `unreachable` state.
  - `emojiLibraryEvent` carries the whole library to a user's connections when their own emoji change, their follows change, or the owner of something they follow changes their emoji. It replaces `emojiEvent` for a user's own emoji, and `emojiEvent` now only covers community emoji.
  - `emojiView` no longer has `copyOf`.
  - The account permission set covers the follow record, `emoji.putFollow` and `emoji.getLibrary`, so existing sessions ask for consent again on their next sign-in.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 56da297: Communities can have custom emoji and emoji packs. They're stored as Bluemoji records in the community's own repo, any repo's emoji can be listed with `emoji.getCatalog`, and changes reach clients live through `emojiEvent`.
