## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- b03c206: Exit on a fatal error so the container restarts clean, guard the async paths that could reach one, and cap the repo CAR buffer

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 1669210: Wait for every mediasoup worker subprocess to exit before the appview process does, so a restart no longer fails on ports the old workers still hold
- 16a342d: Announce a voice join as soon as the peer joins, not when it creates its first transport
- f67763b: Ask Opus for DTX alongside inband FEC, and cap the initial outgoing bitrate estimate

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- dc9ea5c: Default the SFU's RTC port range to 40000-40100, the range the compose file publishes. With neither `SFU_RTC_MIN_PORT` nor `SFU_RTC_MAX_PORT` set, transports took a port from mediasoup's own 10000-59999 default, so almost every candidate pointed at a port nothing forwarded and calls failed to connect.
- 07d1508: Give each account a single voice session. Joining a voice channel now retires that account's other voice sockets with a `superseded` reason, so a second device takes the call over instead of running alongside it, and nobody can sit in two channels at once. A handover within the same channel keeps the participant record, so the rest of the room sees the media move rather than a leave followed by a rejoin.
  
  Along with it, a set of voice fixes:
  
  - A frame the SFU cannot serve is answered with an error instead of rejecting unhandled, which could take the process down when Sentry was not configured.
  - A server mute now pauses every audio producer rather than only the one declaring `mic`, survives the muted account reconnecting, and can be applied before that account carries any media.
  - Voice connections release their topic subscriptions when they close, and frames from one socket are handled in order, so a socket can no longer leave a channel claiming it forever.
  - A transport mediasoup reports as closed or failed is closed rather than only forgotten, releasing its ports and its producers instead of replaying dead producers to everyone who joins.
  - The speaking indicator settles after the debounce window even when no further audio arrives, and clears when a speaker leaves mid-word.
  - A room whose worker died is torn down, so presence stops reporting its participants as being in a call.
  - `produce`, `consume` and `setSelfState` no longer conjure a participant from a frame naming an unknown transport, which used to announce a phantom join to the whole community.
  - Joining replays who is already in the room and what moderation applies to them, and producer frames carry `paused`.
  - Presence is claimed before the room is created, so two devices racing to create transports cannot leave one of them live in an untracked room.
  - `SFU_ICE_SERVERS` reaches clients through `transportOptions`, so configured STUN and TURN servers are used instead of silently dropped.
